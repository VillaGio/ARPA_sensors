#### **Some context**
As environmental challenges become more and more frequent, countries all over the world have started monitoring their emissions levels, as well as setting some common goals to try to not worsen the already critical situation.
<br/>

It Italy, the task of supervising such goals is assigned to the ARPA agency, the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection.
Over the years, ARPA has located several thousands sensors all over Italy, monitoring both the concentration of pollutants in the air (such as PM10, NO2, and CO) and some meteorological conditions (such as rain, wind, and temperature).
<br/>

Given its time of operativity (some sensors were already active during the 80's), the data collected by those sensors constutite a valuable resource to study the evolution of the enviromental distress in Italy.
However, given the considerable large volumes of these data, a proper inspection and understanding of eventual underling behaviours can be hard to spot.
To work around this issue, this dashboard aims to provide a set of interactive tools summarizing the main featuers and trends in the data,  allowing also non-expert users to grasp an idea of what these data are telling us.

#### **What can you expect**
The tools provided space from dynamic statistical graphics to intuitive interactive maps to give everyone the chance to "play  with the data", regardless of their level of knowledge on the topic.
